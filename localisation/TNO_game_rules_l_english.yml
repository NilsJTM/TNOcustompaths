Steve wishes to improve his knowledge of the world and of various societies that exist in a land as obscure, dangerous and unknown as Russia, but it's a journey with a low chance of surviving. Will Steve live long enough to complete his journey?"

Having returned to the United States, Steve will feel uncomfortable and guilty with how he gained all the fame from his journey now that he's back to American safety, while Zoya and the others get no recognition and still live in the Russian anarchy. As such, Steve will write a book detailing the group's adventures, which quickly becomes a best-seller."
